# Homework 1: Simple Model of Spiking Neurons

### Description:
This homework intention is help exploring how to generate simple model of spiking neurons <br> using the equation of Eugene M.Izhikevich

### How to run:
The work was written in Python and deployed using Jupyter Notebook, therefore; please execute each block at a time or execute all the block at the beginning <br> if you run the program normally, nothing will show up.
1. Create a virtual environment <br>
`python -m venv venv`

2. Activate the virtual environment (the following syntax will work on Git Bash) <br>
`source venv/scripts/activate` <br>
or on Command Prompt Window<br>
`venv\scripts\activate `

3. Install the required library <br>
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

And you are good to go.
